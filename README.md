### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Saeed Qatanani
#### A software development passionate.
A Full Stack Developer with a background of Civil Engineering.
After an intensive full stack development boot-camp I became really interested in full stack development specially back-end and would like to further my knowledge in this field.
I learned a lot on such a short period.

Skills: Web fundamentals (HTML , CSS , JavaScript) | Python (Flask framework  , Django framework) | Java | Mysql | MERN.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on expanding my knowledge.  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning new stacks. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: As a kid I was a technology  genius in my parents eyes just because I did restart any inworking device.
